description: Create a git commit with auto-generated message
---
## Context
- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): !`git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -10`

## Your task
Based on the above changes, create a single git commit. Stage relevant files and create the commit with an appropriate message that matches the repository's commit style. Do not commit files containing secrets (.env, credentials). Do not do anything else.
